# Contibutor Guidance

We're intending to apply to be part of GSoC 2023!

## HOW TO APPLY

Short application checklist:

1. **Read the links and instructions** given on this site -- All of it! we've tried to give you all the information you need to be an awesome GSoC applicant.

2. **Choose a project** that you want to contibute to ([check the list here](ProjectIdeas.md)).

3. **Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/the-algorithms-808045925556682782)** to communicate with the members of The Algoriths organization. 

4. **Talk with your prospective mentors** about what they expect of GSoC applicants and get help from them to refine your project ideas. Listening to your mentors' recommendations is very important at this stage!

5. **Prepare a patch for that project**. Usually we expect GSoC contributors to fix a bug and have made a pull request (or equivalent). Your code doesn't have to be accepted and merged, but it does have to be visible to the public and it does have to be your own work.

6. **Write your application** (reachout on discord for help). We have an [Application Template](ApplicationTemplate.md) to help you make sure you include all the information we expect. All applications must go through Google's application system; we can't accept any application unless it is submitted there.

    1. Use a descriptive title and include your project name in Google's system. 
        
        Good example: "Mobile App: Improve user engagement" 
        
        Bad example: "My gsoc project"

    2. Make it easy for your mentors to give you feedback. If you're using Google docs, you can enable comments and submit a "draft" to your mentors. If you're using a format that doesn't accept comments, make sure your email is on the document and don't forget to check for feedback!

7. **Submit your application** to Google before the deadline. We actually recommend you submit a few days early in case you have internet problems or the system is down. Google does not extend this deadline, so it's best to be prepared early! You can edit your application up until the system closes.


### Tip
**Communication** is probably the most important part of the application process. Talk to the mentors and other developers, listen when they give you advice, and demonstrate that you've understood by incorporating their feedback into what you're proposing. We reject a lot of applicants who haven't listened to mentor feedback. If your mentors tell you that a project idea won't work for them, you're probably not going to get accepted unless you change it.



## WHAT GOES IN AN APPLICATION?
An ideal application will contain 5 things:

1. **A descriptive title** including the name of the project you want to work with.
2. **Information about you**, including contact information.
3. Link to a **code contribution** you have made to your organization. (Usually this is a link to a pull request.)
4. Information about your **proposed project**. This should be fairly detailed and include a timeline.
5. **Information about other commitments** that might affect your ability to work during the GSoC period. (exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc.) We can work around a lot of things, but it helps to know in advance.

We also provide an [application template](ApplicationTemplate.md) to help you get started.
