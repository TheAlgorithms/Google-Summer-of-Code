# Personalised Discounts

The Personalized Discounts Project aims to leverage Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to dynamically personalize discounts for customers based on their purchase history and demographics. The objective is to increase customer loyalty and sales while optimizing the company's revenue.

The project will involve collecting and analyzing customer data, such as their age, location, purchase history, and product preferences. This data will then be used to train ML algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks to predict which discounts will be most effective for each customer.

Rather than generating a flat discount of 50% off for everyone, the algorithm should check the purchase history & spending power of the user and provide them discount accordingly. Why should a company give a discount of 50% to someone who is most likely to buy the same at 20% off?

The project will be evaluated based on metrics such as increased customer loyalty, increased sales, and improved customer satisfaction. The results of the project will be used to continuously improve the personalization algorithms, ensuring that they remain effective and relevant over time.
