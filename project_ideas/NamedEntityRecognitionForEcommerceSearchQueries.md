# Named Entity Recognition For E-Commerce Search Queries

### Project Name: EcomEntity

The goal of this project is to build an AI-based Named Entity Recognition for shopping search query parsing that will enable users to search for products on an e-commerce platform with more accuracy and ease. The parser will use natural language processing techniques to understand and interpret the user's search query and match it to the products available on the platform.


The parser will understand the meaning of the user's query and match it with the products available on the platform. Identify the parts of a search query.

For example,

`Adidas Black Shoes for Men under Rs.1000`

Type        | Value
------------|----------
Product     | Shoes  
Brand       | Adidas 
Property    | Black  
Gender      | Men
Currency    | INR    
Price       | 1000   
etc         


Project Goals:

- To collect large annotated corpus to train the model and increase its performance.
- To develop an accurate and reliable Named Entity Recognition Model.
- To make the model open-source and easily accessible to the community.
- Publish the it as
