# The Algorithms Mobile App

Technologies: Flutter, GitHub API, Flask/NodeJs

The Algorithms mobile app provides a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for learning computer science algorithms and data structures. The app features a variety of algorithms and data structures, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms, explained through interactive tutorials and animations. The app includes a range of difficulty levels, so users can start with basic algorithms and gradually progress to more advanced topics. With an intuitive interface and detailed explanations, the app is the perfect tool for anyone looking to learn or improve their understanding of algorithms and data structures.

The project would have 2 parts
1. Mobile App (Frontend)
    
    - Come up with a UI/UX for the app.
    - Use Flutter to create the app.
    - Hit the server for login/signup and fetching data.

2. Server (Backend)
    - Use Flask/NodeJs to create the server.
    - Fetch the data present in various repositories for data structures & algorithms and their explainantions in various languages.
