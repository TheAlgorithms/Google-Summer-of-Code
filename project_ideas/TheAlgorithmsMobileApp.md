# The Algorithms Mobile App

The Algorithms mobile app provides a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for learning computer science algorithms and data structures. The app features a variety of algorithms and data structures, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms, explained through interactive tutorials and animations. The app includes a range of difficulty levels, so users can start with basic algorithms and gradually progress to more advanced topics. With an intuitive interface and detailed explanations, the app is the perfect tool for anyone looking to learn or improve their understanding of algorithms and data structures.

The project would have 2 parts
1. Mobile App (Frontend)
    
    - Come up with a UI/UX for the app.
    - Use Flutter to create the app.
    - Hit the server for login/signup and fetching data.

2. Server (Backend)
    - Use Flask/NodeJs to create the server.
    - Fetch the data present in various repositories for data structures & algorithms and their explainantions in various languages.

Key Features

1. Algorithm Library: The app will provide users with a comprehensive library of algorithms and data structures. Each algorithm will be described in detail, including its time and space complexity, as well as its applications.
2. Progress Tracker: The app will keep track of the user's progress and provide them with a dashboard that shows their progress over time. The dashboard will also show their progress relative to other users, so that they can see how they stack up against the competition.
3. User Profile: The app will allow users to create a profile and store their progress, so that they can pick up where they left off the next time they use the app.
