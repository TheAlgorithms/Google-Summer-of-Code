An ideal application will contain 5 things:
1. A **descriptive title** including the name of the **projects** you want to work with.
2. **Information about you**, including contact information.
3. Link to a **code contribution** you have made to your organization. (Usually this is a link to a pull request.)
4. Information about your **proposed project**. This should be fairly detailed and include a **timeline**.
5. Information about **other commitments** that might affect your ability to work during the GSoC period. (exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc.) We can work around a lot of things, but it helps to know in advance.

Sample Application Template:
# Project name: The thing I want to do this summer

**Note**: Make sure to include the project name in the title both in Google's system and in your document.

## About me
1. Name (and nicknames like your github and irc usernames)
2. University / program / year / expected graduation date
3. Contact info (email, phone, discord username etc.)
4. Time zone
5. Link to a resume (if you want)

## Code contribution
* Link to a pull request or code sample goes here.
  * Ideally this should be code submitted to your chosen project as a pull request or patch.
  * It must represent your own work, although you can have help from developers to improve it.
  * It must be publicly visible to your mentors and org admins.
  * You can link more than one if you want.

## Project information
1. Project name
2. Project Abstract
3. Detailed description
4. Weekly timeline
   * The default schedule for GSoC is 12 weeks, either full-time or part-time. See [the GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) for precise dates. This template assumes you'll be using those 12 weeks; if you're doing an alternate schedule you can adjust appropriately.
   * **Community Bonding**: List any prepwork you want to do before coding starts.
   * For each coding week below, list planned code deliverables. Break the project into weeks and estimate what you will have complete at the end of each one.  This schedule can be adjusted later if need be.

   * **Week 1** Note that usually even week 1's deliverables should include some code.
   * **Week 2**
   * **Week 3**
   * **Week 4**
   * **Week 5**
   * **Week 6** Midterm point. You need enough done at this point for your mentor to evaluate your progress and pass you.  Usually you want to be a bit more than half done.
   * **Week 7**
   * **Week 8**
   * **Week 9**
   * **Week 10**
   * **Week 11** you may want to try to "code freeze" in week 11 and complete any tests/documentation in week 11-12.
   * **Week 12**
   * **Final week**:  This week you will be submitting your projects


## Other commitments
* List of any things that might affect your ability to work this summer.
   * List any exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc. We can work around a lot of things, but it helps to know in advance.
* If you're applying to more than one organization, you can let us know which one you prefer in case of a tie.
