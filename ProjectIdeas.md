## Named Entity Recognition for Ecommerce Search Queries

```
Technologies: Python, AI/ML, NLP
```

The goal of this project is to build an AI-based Named Entity Recognition for shopping search query parsing that will enable users to search for products on an e-commerce platform with more accuracy and ease. The parser will use natural language processing techniques to understand and interpret the user's search query and match it to the products available on the platform.

## Anomalous Session Recorder

```
Technologies: Python, AI/ML, NoSQL, Data Visualization
```

This library aims to record and analyze user sessions on a web application to detect and flag any anomalies. Anomalies can be defined as deviant or unusual behavior, such as sudden spikes in activity, accessibility issues, page not working or access to restricted resources.

## The Algorithms website

```
Technologies: ReactJS, Node.Js, HTML, CSS
```

The Algorithms website exist today with some basic functionalities. The idea is to have a well versed website with enhanced functionalities like:
  - Gamification features like leaderboard of top contributors.
  - Enhanced search functionality of algorithms within the website.
  - Coin related gamification, e.g. 1 coin per PR merged which can be further redeemed for swags.
  - Sources to read more about how complex algorithms are used in the tech world.
